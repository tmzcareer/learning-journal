# SQL

# row_number() vs group by
select DEPARTMENT, SALARY, row_number() over(partition by DEPARTMENT order by SALARY) RANK from EMPLOYEE where RANK = 1;
select DEPARTMENT, max(SALARY) from EMPLOYEE group by DEPARTMENT;???

select *, Ranking from
(SELECT dept_no, salary, row_number() over(partition by dept_no order by salary) Ranking from 
(select x.dept_no, a.salary from employees.dept_emp x
left join salaries a on x.emp_no = a.emp_no
) temp1
)temp2
where Ranking = 1; 可以


select *, Ranking from
(SELECT x.dept_no, a.salary, row_number() over(partition by dept_no order by salary) Ranking from  employees.dept_emp x
left join salaries a on x.emp_no = a.emp_no
) temp1
where Ranking = 1;可以


SELECT x.dept_no, a.salary, row_number() over(partition by dept_no order by salary) Ranking from  employees.dept_emp x
left join salaries a on x.emp_no = a.emp_no
where Ranking = 1; 不行







# where vs left join on

# sql vs pandas dummy??
